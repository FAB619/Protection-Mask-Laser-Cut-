# üö´ IMPORTANT !! Sterilizing for Medical Use
It is highly recommended to submerge (sink) the shield parts into disinfection solutions (ex Sodium hypochlorite, Isopropyl alcohol )
for more than 5 minutes, this way you will ensure that the solution reaches 100 % of the surface. You can also use aerosol (spray) but apply the procedure at least twice to reach most of the surface.

# üöß A Note About Safety and Liability
This documentation will be continuously improved as soon there are updates for doctors needs.

There are engineering and manufacturing risks around medical devices. Though the FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices, FDA), to avoid doing more harm than good, it is recommended to attempt to the best of your ability and circumstances to follow regulations, which may seem cumbersome, but exist for good reason.
